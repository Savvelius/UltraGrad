# UltraGrad
Deep learning framework in C++

This is a project whose purpose was to teach me about internals of neural networks. It doesn't have backpropagation engine so you can't really train a neural network with it.
However, it does support all required math operations for n-dimensional arrays. You can check how those work in engine.cpp.
